**Acute kidney injury (AKI)**[3] is a **common clinical syndrome**[3] characterised by **abnormal renal function and structure.**[3] The **current criteria for diagnosing AKI**[3] are a **sharp decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR)**[3], an **acute increase in serum creatinine (SCr) levels**[3], or a **decrease in urine output (UO) over a fixed period.**[3] \n\n**Several biomarkers have been suggested to diagnose AKI and evaluate its progression.**[0] These biomarkers can be classified into **three types**[0], based on the **recommendations from the Acute Disease Quality Initiative Consensus Conference**[0]:\n- **Stress markers**[0], which **reflect cell stress and may resolve or become aggravated.**[0]\n- **Damage markers**[0], which **indicate structural damage that may or may not result in reduced renal function.**[0]\n- **Functional markers**[0], which **correlate with alterations in glomerular filtration.**[0] \n\n**Chronic kidney disease (CKD)**[1] is defined as the **presence of albuminuria**[1] and/or a **reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) to less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m^2.**[1] While **existing measures like creatinine level, eGFR, and proteinuria are used**[2], they are considered **insufficient for early diagnosis and identifying those at risk of progressing to end-stage renal disease (ESRD)**[2]. \n\nTherefore, **novel biomarkers are required for CKD**[2], and a **panel of biomarkers rather than a single marker is likely needed**[2] to **diagnose CKD effectively and identify those at high risk of progression.**[2] These new biomarkers are also expected to **improve the prediction of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in CKD patients.**[2]
