- **Assessment**:
    - The patient, a 45-year-old male, presents with persistent back pain and occasional headaches, poorly relieved by over-the-counter medications. Examination shows no acute distress or neurological deficits, suggesting musculoskeletal strain and tension-type headaches as likely diagnoses. Initial conservative management will include NSAIDs and physical therapy. If symptoms persist, further imaging and possibly more aggressive treatments will be considered. This strategy ensures careful monitoring while avoiding unnecessary risks.

        - **Patient Education**: Instructed on proper posture and lifting techniques.
    - **#TensionHeadaches**:
        - **Management Plan**: Advise stress reduction techniques and adequate hydration.
        - **Treatment Options**: Use of over-the-counter pain relievers as needed.
        - **Monitoring and Follow-up**: Re-evaluate in 4 weeks; earlier if symptoms escalate.
        - **Patient Education**: Educated about the signs of medication overuse headaches.
